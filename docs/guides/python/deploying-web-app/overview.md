Flet app can be deployed as a "standalone" web app which means both your Python app and Flet web server are deployed together as a bundle.

## Choosing hosting provider

Flet apps use WebSockets for real-time partial updates of their UI and sending events back to your program.
When choosing a hosting provider for your Flet app you should pay attention to their support of WebSockets. Sometimes WebSockets are not allowed or come as a part of more expensive offering, sometimes there is a proxy that periodically breaks WebSocket connection by a timeout (Flet implements re-connection logic, but it could be unpleasant behavior for users of your app anyway).

Another important factor while choosing a hosting provider for Flet app is latency. Every user action on UI sends a message to Flet app and the app sends updated UI back to user. Make sure your hosting provider has multiple data centers, so you can run your app closer to the majority of your users.
