### AppBar

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    def check_item_clicked(e):
        e.control.checked = not e.control.checked
        page.update()

    page.appbar = ft.AppBar(
        leading=ft.Icon(ft.icons.PALETTE),
        leading_width=40,
        title=ft.Text("AppBar Example"),
        center_title=False,
        bgcolor=ft.colors.SURFACE_VARIANT,
        actions=[
            ft.IconButton(ft.icons.WB_SUNNY_OUTLINED),
            ft.IconButton(ft.icons.FILTER_3),
            ft.PopupMenuButton(
                items=[
                    ft.PopupMenuItem(text="Item 1"),
                    ft.PopupMenuItem(),  # divider
                    ft.PopupMenuItem(
                        text="Checked item", checked=False, on_click=check_item_clicked
                    ),
                ]
            ),

## Properties

### `actions`

A list of `Control`s to display in a row after the title control.

Typically these controls are [`IconButtons`](iconbutton) representing common operations. For less common operations, consider using a [`PopupMenuButton`](popupmenubutton) as the last action.

**Note** that, if `AppBar.adaptive=True` and the app is opened on an iOS or macOS device, only the first element of this list will be used. This is because the `CupertinoAppBar`(which will be used on those two platforms) only accepts one - trailing - action control.

### `adaptive`

If the value is `True`, an adaptive AppBar is created based on whether the target platform is iOS/macOS.

On iOS and macOS, a [`CupertinoAppBar`](/docs/controls/cupertinoappbar) is created, which has matching functionality and presentation as `AppBar`, and the graphics as expected on iOS. On other platforms, a Material AppBar is created.

The default value is `False`.

### `automatically_imply_leading`

Controls whether we should try to imply the leading widget if null.

If `True` and `leading` is null, automatically try to deduce what the leading widget should be. If `False` and `leading` is null, leading space is given to title. If leading widget is not null, this parameter has no effect.

### `bgcolor`

The fill [color](/docs/guides/python/colors) to use for an AppBar. Default color is defined by current theme.

### `center_title`

Whether the title should be centered. Default is `False`.

### `color`

The default [color](/docs/guides/python/colors) for Text and Icons within the app bar. Default color is defined by current theme.

### `elevation`

This property controls the size of the shadow below the app bar. Default value is 4.

Note: This effect is only visible when using the Material 2 design (when `Theme.use_material3=False`).

### `leading`

A `Control` to display before the toolbar's title.

Typically the leading control is an [`Icon`](icon) or an [`IconButton`](iconbutton).

### `leading_width`

Defines the width of leading control. By default, the value of `leading_width` is `56.0`.

### `title`

The primary `Control` displayed in the app bar. Typically a [`Text`](text) control that contains a description of the current contents of the app.

**Note** that, if `AppBar.adaptive=True` and the app is opened on an iOS or macOS device, this control will be automatically centered.

### `toolbar_height`

Defines the height of the toolbar component of an AppBar. By default, the value of `toolbar_height` is `56.0`.
