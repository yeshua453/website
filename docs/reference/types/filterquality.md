`FilterQuality` enum has the following values:

* `NONE`
* `LOW`
* `MEDIUM`
* `HIGH`

More details on each [here](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/FilterQuality.html).

When building for the web using the `html` WebRenderer, filter quality has no effect - all images are rendered using the respective browser's default setting.
